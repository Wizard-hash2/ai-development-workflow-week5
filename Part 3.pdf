** Ethics & Bias (10 points) **

Biased training data can lead to unfair treatment of marginalized groups and potentially worsen patient outcomes. 
For instance, if the model is trained on historical data with disparities, it may underperform on patients from these groups, exacerbating existing health inequities.

**Strategy to Mitigate Bias**

Audit data for representativeness and enforce fairness constraints to prevent biased training data from affecting patient outcomes.

**Trade-offs (10 points)**

The trade-off between model interpretability and accuracy in healthcare is crucial.
On one hand, models that are highly interpretable can provide valuable insights into clinical decision-making, 
but they may sacrifice accuracy.
On the other hand, highly accurate models may be complex and difficult to interpret, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

**Impact of Limited Computational Resources**

If the hospital has limited computational resources, 
it may impact model choice by favoring simpler models that are less computationally intensive. 
This could lead to a trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability, as simpler models may be more interpretable but less accurate.

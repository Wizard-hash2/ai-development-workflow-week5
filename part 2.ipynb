    "\r\n",
    "## **Problem Scope (5 points)**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Problem Definition:**\r\n",
    "Develop an AI system to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital within **30 days post-discharge**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Objectives:**\r\n",
    "- 🚑 Reduce avoidable readmissions by flagging high-risk patients for targeted interventions.  \r\n",
    "- ⚙️ Optimize resource allocation (e.g., follow-up calls, post-discharge care).  \r\n",
    "- ❤️ Improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Stakeholders:**\r\n",
    "- **Patients:** Receive proactive care to prevent readmission.  \r\n",
    "- **Clinicians:** Use predictions to personalize discharge plans.  \r\n",
    "- **Hospital Administrators:** Reduce financial penalties under value-based care models.  \r\n",
    "- **Payers (Insurers):** Lower costs from preventable readmissions.  \r\n",
    "- **Data/IT Teams:** Maintain data pipelines and model deployment infrastructure.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **Data Strategy (10 points)**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Proposed Data Sources:**\r\n",
    "- **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** Diagnoses, medications, lab results, procedures, vital signs.  \r\n",
    "- **Demographics:** Age, gender, socioeconomic status, ZIP code (social determinants).  \r\n",
    "- **Admission/Discharge Records:** Length of stay, discharge disposition, prior admissions.  \r\n",
    "- **Medication Adherence:** Pharmacy records or patient self-reported data.  \r\n",
    "- **Comorbidity Indices:** e.g., Charlson Comorbidity Index.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Ethical Concerns:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 🔒 Patient Privacy:\r\n",
    "- **Risk:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., diagnosis codes) violating HIPAA.  \r\n",
    "- **Mitigation:** Data de-identification, encryption, and strict access controls.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### ⚖️ Bias in Training Data:\r\n",
    "- **Risk:** Model underperforms on marginalized groups due to historical disparities.  \r\n",
    "- **Mitigation:** Audit data for representativeness and enforce fairness constraints.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Preprocessing Pipeline:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 🧹 Data Cleaning:\r\n",
    "- Impute missing values: **Median** for numerical, **mode** for categorical.  \r\n",
    "- Drop columns with >50% missing values.  \r\n",
    "- Remove duplicates and standardize data formats.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### ⚙️ Feature Engineering:\r\n",
    "- **Temporal Features:** Days since last admission, admission frequency.  \r\n",
    "- **Clinical Aggregates:** Comorbidity count, polypharmacy indicator (≥5 medications).  \r\n",
    "- **Socioeconomic Proxies:** Area Deprivation Index (from ZIP code).  \r\n",
    "- **Discharge Context:** Length of stay, discharge day.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 🔠 Encoding & Scaling:\r\n",
    "- **One-hot encode** categorical variables.  \r\n",
    "- **Standardize** numerical values.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### ⚖️ Class Balancing:\r\n",
    "- Use **SMOTE** or **downsampling** to address class imbalance in readmission labels.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **Model Development (10 points)**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Model Selection:**\r\n",
    "- **Chosen Model:** Gradient Boosting Machine (e.g., XGBoost)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Justification:**\r\n",
    "- Handles mixed data types (numeric + categorical).  \r\n",
    "- Captures nonlinear interactions between variables.  \r\n",
    "- Delivers **feature importance** for clinical interpretability.  \r\n",
    "- Robust against outliers; superior performance over logistic regression.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "| Actual \\ Predicted   | Readmitted | Not Readmitted |\r\n",
    "|----------------------|------------|----------------|\r\n",
    "| **Readmitted**       | 90 (TP)    | 50 (FN)        |\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "- **Precision:** 90 / (90 + 60) = **60%**  \r\n",
    "  > *60% of flagged patients were correctly high-risk.*\r\n",

    "## **Deployment (10 points)**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Integration Steps:**\r\n",
    "- **API Development:** Expose model via REST API (e.g., FastAPI).  \r\n",
    "- **EHR Integration:** Trigger model at discharge; feed real-time data from hospital systems.  \r\n",
    "- **Clinician Dashboard:** Display risk scores within Epic or other EHR dashboards.  \r\n",
    "- **Alert System:** Notify care teams of high-risk patients through email/EHR alerts.  \r\n",
    "- **Model Retraining:** Monthly batch updates with latest patient data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Regulatory Compliance (HIPAA):**\r\n",
    "- **Data Minimization:** Collect only essential features.  \r\n",
    "- **Encryption:** Encrypt all stored and transmitted data.  \r\n",
    "- **Access Controls:** Role-based access (e.g., only assigned clinicians).  \r\n",
    "- **Audit Logs:** Track access and prediction usage.  \r\n",
    "- **BAAs:** Ensure all cloud providers sign HIPAA-compliant Business Associate Agreements.\r\n",

    "### **Method to Address Overfitting:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### ✅ Technique: **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (5-fold)**\r\n",
    "- Maintains class distribution in each fold.  \r\n",
    "- Trains on 4 folds, validates on 1 — repeated 5 times.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Implementation:**\r\n",
    "1. Split dataset into 5 stratified folds.\r\n",
    "2. Train model 5 times (each time on a different train-validation split).\r\n",
    "3. Tune hyperparameters (e.g., `max_depth`, `learning_rate`) using validation performance.\r\n",
    "4. Select the best config based on **average recall** (prioritizing capturing true readmissions).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Why It Works:**\r\n",
    "- Reduces the chance of overfitting to specific data subsets.  \r\n",
    "- Enhances generalization to unseen patient data.\r\n"
